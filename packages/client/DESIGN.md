# Design System: Workflow Graph

## 1. Overview

**Creative North Star: "The Instrument Panel"**

Workflow Graph's editor is a cockpit for automation. The chrome recedes into graphite so the workflow graph owns the screen, and every light that comes on means something: a green border is a successful run, a red border is a failure, an animated border is work in progress. The user should feel they are reading gauges, never decoration.

The system is built from shadcn/ui (new-york style) on Base UI primitives, styled with Tailwind v4 tokens declared in OKLCH. It is deliberately conventional where convention earns trust: standard buttons, standard dialogs, standard form controls, in the vocabulary a Linear or Vercel user already speaks. The strategic anti-references from PRODUCT.md hold here: this must never resemble the colorful n8n/Zapier canvas where every node shouts its brand, and it must never drift into SaaS-generic gradients and cream tints.

**Key Characteristics:**

- Achromatic field: every surface, border, and text color is a zero-chroma graphite step.
- Color is signal: chroma appears only on run status, destructive actions, and integration icons.
- Refined and restrained components: quiet at rest, precise on interaction.
- Both themes are first-class; dark mode is a true-black inversion, ink and paper swapped.

## 2. Colors: Graphite & Signal

An achromatic graphite ramp carries the entire interface; saturated hues exist only as signals.

### Primary

- **Graphite Ink** (oklch(0.145 0 0)): Primary text and the filled action color. The default button is ink on paper; in dark mode the roles invert (near-white on black).

### Neutral

- **Paper** (oklch(1 0 0)): The content surface and card background in light mode.
- **Panel** (oklch(0.985 0 0)): The sidebar layer, half a step off Paper so panels read as a separate plane without a border doing all the work.
- **Graphite Wash** (oklch(0.97 0 0)): Secondary and muted fills: hover states, secondary buttons, muted badges.
- **Graphite Line** (oklch(0.922 0 0)): Hairline borders and input strokes (oklch(0.27 0 0) in dark mode).
- **Graphite Mid** (oklch(0.556 0 0)): Muted foreground for descriptions and placeholders. This is the darkest gray allowed to carry text on Paper (4.5:1 floor); anything lighter is decorative only.
- **Void** (oklch(0 0 0)): Dark mode's background. True black, tuned for the OLED-dark canvas where the graph floats.

### Tertiary (signals)

Each signal is one token carrying both the fill and the text form, and each light-mode value is solved so its text form clears 4.5:1 on its own 10% tint, which is the `bg-x/10 text-x` pattern the run panel uses throughout.

- **Signal Red** (oklch(0.577 0.245 27.325)): Destructive actions and failed runs. `--destructive`.
- **Signal Green** (oklch(0.526 0.148 149.58)): Successful runs. `--success`.
- **Signal Amber** (oklch(0.546 0.12 70.08)): Waiting runs, test mode, and unmet prerequisites. `--warning`.
- **Signal Blue** (oklch(0.482 0.18 259.8)): Work in progress, including the running-node border sweep, and live template variables. `--info`.
- **Signal Slate** (oklch(0.52 0.046 257.417)): Cancelled and superseded runs. `--cancelled`.

### Node-type accents

Four hues name what a built-in node does: `--node-lifecycle`, `--node-split`, `--node-wait`, `--node-condition`. These are a deliberate exception to the Signal Rule, kept because node type is the fastest thing to read on a dense canvas. Each is a single value clearing 3:1 against both card surfaces, so it serves light and dark without a variant, which is what WCAG 1.4.11 asks of a graphic carrying meaning.

The exception is bounded. It applies to the glyph of a built-in node and to nothing else: never a node fill, never a border, never a panel. A plugin's identity still lives in its own icon.

### Named Rules

**The Signal Rule.** Chroma is earned by state. If an element is not communicating run status, a destructive consequence, selection, or an integration's identity, it is grayscale. There is no decorative color anywhere in the editor.

**The One Ramp Rule.** All neutrals come from the zero-chroma graphite ramp. The single exception is Signal Slate, which carries cancelled and superseded runs: the tint is what separates "this run stopped" from "this text is quiet", and it is spent on status rather than on the field. Everywhere else a warm or cool tinted gray breaks the achromatic field.

## 3. Typography

**UI Font:** Geist (with ui-sans-serif, system-ui fallback)
**Mono Font:** Geist Mono (with ui-monospace fallback), for template variables, code editors, and log output

**Character:** A single well-tuned grotesque carries the whole interface, which is correct for a product register: headings, labels, buttons, and data all speak in one voice, differentiated by weight and the muted-foreground color rather than by family or dramatic size jumps.

Both families are self-hosted through Fontsource variable packages, imported in `main.tsx`; `--font-geist-sans` and `--font-geist-mono` are defined in `globals.css` and point at "Geist Variable" and "Geist Mono Variable".

### Hierarchy

- **Title** (600, 1rem, 1.375): Card titles, node titles, dialog headings. The largest text in the working UI.
- **Label** (500, 0.875rem, 1.25): Buttons, form labels, tabs, menu items.
- **Body** (400, 0.875rem, 1.5): Descriptions, settings prose, run detail text. `text-base` (1rem) only on mobile inputs to prevent iOS zoom.
- **Mono** (400, 0.8125rem, 1.5): Template expressions, cron strings, JSON output, execution logs.
- **Caption** (400, 0.75rem, 1.35): Canvas edge labels, node status chips, handle labels, and secondary run metadata. The floor of the scale. Nothing renders below it; the 10px and 11px values that used to sit here were arbitrary rather than a step.

### Named Rules

**The Fixed Scale Rule.** Sizes are fixed rem steps. No clamp(), no fluid type; this is a tool viewed at desktop DPI, and hierarchy comes from weight and color before size.

## 4. Elevation

Depth follows shadcn's native vocabulary and nothing more: hairline borders define structure, a whisper of shadow keeps surfaces from feeling painted on, and real shadow is reserved for things that genuinely float. In dark mode, tonal layering does most of the work (Void background, 0.205-lightness cards, 0.15 washes) because shadows read poorly on black. The card step has to survive 8-bit quantisation to do that job: anything under about oklch(0.12) rounds to the same rgb(0,0,0) as the background and separates by nothing at all.

### Shadow Vocabulary

- **shadow-xs** (`0 1px 2px 0 rgb(0 0 0 / 0.05)`): Form controls and outline buttons at rest.
- **shadow-sm** (`0 1px 3px 0 rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1), 0 1px 2px -1px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1)`): Cards and workflow nodes.
- **shadow-lg** (`0 10px 15px -3px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1), 0 4px 6px -4px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1)`): Dialogs, dropdown menus, popovers: true overlays only.

### Named Rules

**The Overlay Rule.** Anything at shadow-lg must be dismissible. If it can't be dismissed, it isn't floating, and it doesn't get the shadow.

## 5. Components

All primitives are shadcn/ui new-york on Base UI, refined and restrained: quiet at rest, precise on interaction. Focus is always the 3px `ring-ring/50` halo with a border-color shift; hover is always a fill change, never movement.

### Buttons

- **Shape:** Gently rounded (8px), 36px tall at default size.
- **Primary:** Graphite Ink fill with Paper text, hover dims to 90% opacity.
- **Outline:** Paper fill, hairline border, shadow-xs; hover fills with Graphite Wash.
- **Ghost:** Transparent until hovered, then Graphite Wash.
- **Destructive:** Signal Red fill; the only chromatic button.
- **Focus:** 3px ring at 50% ring color plus a border shift, visible in both themes. `--ring` is oklch(0.6 0 0) in light so the border shift clears the 3:1 that WCAG 1.4.11 asks of a focus indicator.

### Cards / Containers

- **Corner Style:** 14px (rounded-xl), the roundest shape in the system.
- **Background:** Paper with hairline Graphite Line border.
- **Shadow Strategy:** shadow-sm per the Elevation section.
- **Internal Padding:** 24px vertical rhythm, 16px on the small variant.

### Inputs / Fields

- **Style:** Transparent background, hairline border, 8px radius, 36px height, shadow-xs.
- **Focus:** Border shifts to ring color plus the 3px halo.
- **Error:** `aria-invalid` drives a Signal Red border and red-tinted ring; error state is attribute-driven, never a bespoke class.
- **Disabled:** 50% opacity with pointer events off.

### Workflow Node (signature component)

The reason the product exists. A 192×112px rectangular card at 8px radius sitting on the React Flow canvas: integration icon, title, and description at rest. Event Split is wider at 264px on purpose, because it carries two labelled outlets. Nested Group children are compact (188×56) so the frame reads as one step; parallel lookups sit side by side inside it. 192×112 remains the top-level card. The card is flat; elevation on the canvas would compete with the status border.

Status is worn on the border: a 2px Signal Green border for success, Signal Red for failure, Signal Slate for cancelled, and an animated Signal Blue sweep while running. Every status also renders its word in a chip, so the border is never the only carrier.

Handles are 12px dots in Graphite Ink with a hairline ring, and their hit areas are 24px on desktop and 44px on touch. Those sizes are divided by `--rf-zoom`, the live canvas scale the viewport transform applies, because a flat pixel size inside that transform shrinks with the zoom and delivered 24.6px on a phone.

Edges leave the bottom handle, travel in a rounded orthogonal step, and enter the top handle of the next node. The dash is the wire; a label sits on the horizontal span when the outlet has a name.

### Navigation

A quiet toolbar over the canvas and a Panel-toned sidebar for workflow lists and run history. Selection state uses Graphite Wash fills; the active workflow is marked by tone, never by an accent stripe.

## 6. Do's and Don'ts

### Do:

- **Do** keep every neutral at zero chroma; the graphite ramp is the entire field.
- **Do** route every status color through its token (`--destructive`, `--success`, `--warning`, `--info`, `--cancelled`). A Tailwind palette class like `green-500` in the editor is a defect.
- **Do** hold body and muted text at or above 4.5:1: Graphite Mid (oklch(0.556 0 0)) is the lightness floor for text on Paper.
- **Do** use the standard component vocabulary everywhere; a save button looks identical on every screen.
- **Do** keep motion in the 150–250ms band, easing out, conveying state (the running-node border sweep is the model).
- **Do** honor `prefers-reduced-motion` with a static alternative for every animation, including the node border sweep.

### Don't:

- **Don't** recreate the colorful n8n/Zapier canvas; integration identity lives in the icon, never in node fills or borders (PRODUCT.md's named anti-reference).
- **Don't** introduce SaaS-generic styling: gradient accents, cream-tinted backgrounds, identical marketing card grids (PRODUCT.md's second anti-reference).
- **Don't** use color decoratively; if it isn't status, selection, destruction, or an integration icon, it's graphite.
- **Don't** add display fonts, clamp-scaled headings, or letter-spaced uppercase eyebrows; this is an instrument, and it speaks in one typeface at fixed sizes.
- **Don't** put shadow-lg on anything that can't be dismissed.
- **Don't** animate layout properties on the canvas; transform and opacity only, or React Flow's frame rate pays for it.
