### Patch Changes

- [#84](https://github.com/alandotcom/wfgraph/pull/84) [`33a616f`](https://github.com/alandotcom/wfgraph/commit/33a616f4118adb125f578627a21310a1ca24912f) Thanks [@alandotcom](https://github.com/alandotcom)! - Each package now ships its own README, so its npm page describes what it is rather than
  offering to let someone add one, and declares `engines.node` at the Node 24 floor the repo
  already builds against, so an install on an older runtime warns instead of failing later.

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- First published release. `@wfgraph/core` carries the run engine, the authoring
  vocabulary and `createWfGraphApp`; `@wfgraph/client` carries the editor bundle a
  host hands it; `@wfgraph/plugins` carries the six built-in integrations.
