Document forward-compatible action evolution in `docs/integrations.md`.

### Minor Changes

- [#115](https://github.com/alandotcom/wfgraph/pull/115) [`4f34676`](https://github.com/alandotcom/wfgraph/commit/4f34676d7049a9a2577e873c1a79da9a89d43e09) Thanks [@alandotcom](https://github.com/alandotcom)! - Let an action declare `sideEffect: true` when running it changes something
  outside the workflow, and hold a Group to lookups on that answer. `defineAction`
  and an integration's action literal both take the field, it defaults to `false`,
  and it reaches the browser on the extension catalog. The seven writes the
  built-in plugins ship now declare it, so grouping a Send Email or a Delete User
  is refused rather than accepted against the Group contract.

  Fix two Group defects on the canvas. Deleting a frame with the Delete key left
  its interior edges and any collapsed inlet edge in the graph naming steps that
  were gone, which the next save refused. An edge running from one frame's exit
  into another frame's entry painted on the two members instead of the two frames,
  so auto-layout read the frames as unconnected.

  Cut some of the canvas render cost. A graph whose nodes were left out of the
  order React Flow wants paid a re-sort and an allocation on every render, drag
  frames included, and grouping a second selection, ungrouping one of two frames,
  and pasting a frame each left it that way; all three now keep the order. The
  painted edges also come back as the array they went in as for a graph with no
  frame, though one holding a frame still rebuilds them per node change.

### Major Changes

- [#93](https://github.com/alandotcom/wfgraph/pull/93) [`e83fb18`](https://github.com/alandotcom/wfgraph/commit/e83fb18c1ed52a30cfea1c38aa66b69cd0b6630a) Thanks [@alandotcom](https://github.com/alandotcom)! - Remove the Acuity integration. `@wfgraph/plugins` now ships five built-ins (Clerk, Linear,
  Resend, Slack, Twilio), the `acuity` export and its `integrationUi` entry are gone, and the
  `@fountain-bio/acuity` dependency is dropped. A host importing `acuity` by name must delete
  that import; a host passing `builtInIntegrations` needs no change. Stored `acuity`
  connections and any workflow node on an `acuity/*` action no longer resolve to a registered
  integration.

### Patch Changes

- [#84](https://github.com/alandotcom/wfgraph/pull/84) [`33a616f`](https://github.com/alandotcom/wfgraph/commit/33a616f4118adb125f578627a21310a1ca24912f) Thanks [@alandotcom](https://github.com/alandotcom)! - Each package now ships its own README, so its npm page describes what it is rather than
  offering to let someone add one, and declares `engines.node` at the Node 24 floor the repo
  already builds against, so an install on an older runtime warns instead of failing later.

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- First published release. `@wfgraph/core` carries the run engine, the authoring
  vocabulary and `createWfGraphApp`; `@wfgraph/client` carries the editor bundle a
  host hands it; `@wfgraph/plugins` carries the six built-in integrations.
