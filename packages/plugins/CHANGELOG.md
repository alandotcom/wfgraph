# @wfgraph/plugins

## 4.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#157](https://github.com/alandotcom/wfgraph/pull/157) [`dea6043`](https://github.com/alandotcom/wfgraph/commit/dea6043a2455cda99058ac23d6e4421751c1e606) Thanks [@alandotcom](https://github.com/alandotcom)! - Add OAuth connections for Resend and Slack. Call `builtInIntegrations()` to configure the built-in set, and pass `slack.oauthClient` to enable Slack OAuth. Clerk, Linear, Resend, and Twilio remain exported integration values; Slack is a factory because it accepts host-provided client credentials.

  Core owns browser-bound, one-use authorization attempts, PKCE, encrypted grants, serialized token refresh, and revoke-before-delete behavior. A new OAuth connection is stored only after its authorization callback succeeds.

### Minor Changes

- [#181](https://github.com/alandotcom/wfgraph/pull/181) [`cbd75a8`](https://github.com/alandotcom/wfgraph/commit/cbd75a8e57b27d242ffededcd1d866d92fa377f1) Thanks [@alandotcom](https://github.com/alandotcom)! - Show a connection's stored value as the placeholder for the config field that falls back to it. Resend's From, and Twilio's From Number and Messaging Service SID, are optional on the node and the handler reads the connection when they are blank; the editor now says which value that is instead of drawing a generic example.

  An action config field declares the fallback with `connectionDefaultKey`, naming one of the integration's own credentials, held to that set by the type. `checkIntegration` refuses a key the integration does not declare and refuses a `password` one, since the browser holds a mask in place of a secret. That declaration is also the allowlist for the new `connectionDefaults` on a connection summary: a stored value no field names never reaches the editor.

  Also fixes a template field redrawing only when its text changed, which left a stale placeholder on screen after the value behind it moved.

- [#187](https://github.com/alandotcom/wfgraph/pull/187) [`9d7e2bd`](https://github.com/alandotcom/wfgraph/commit/9d7e2bd9fb2e9f0c3c63d86cec01651592ea51d1) Thanks [@alandotcom](https://github.com/alandotcom)! - Add a Resend Find Email action that retrieves a sent email by ID and exposes its
  delivery details, content, recipients, and tags to downstream workflow nodes.

- [#182](https://github.com/alandotcom/wfgraph/pull/182) [`30d78c4`](https://github.com/alandotcom/wfgraph/commit/30d78c4e4c07e571ab84974aa987e9d8491846dc) Thanks [@alandotcom](https://github.com/alandotcom)! - Add a PostHog built-in with capture/identify and CIMD OAuth.

- [#157](https://github.com/alandotcom/wfgraph/pull/157) [`dea6043`](https://github.com/alandotcom/wfgraph/commit/dea6043a2455cda99058ac23d6e4421751c1e606) Thanks [@alandotcom](https://github.com/alandotcom)! - Pick a Resend template from the connection instead of typing its id. The Send Email action's Template field lists the account's own templates, drafts labelled as such, and the Template Variables field draws one input per variable that template declares. A variable Resend has a fallback for is prefilled with it and left out of what is sent, so Resend applies it; a variable with no fallback is marked required, because Resend refuses the send without one.

  Reading templates needs Resend's full-access grant, which its own scope vocabulary offers nothing narrower than. A send-only connection says so in the field and keeps the plain id input, so nothing that worked before stops working.

  A provider may report a field as `required` on `ConfigOptionField`, which the editor draws as a required input.

  Fixes an OAuth adapter's granted-access label being able to fail a token refresh: `grantedAccessLabel` is what a dialog draws, so a scope the adapter cannot word now answers nothing rather than turning a working grant into one an operator has to reauthorize.

- [#196](https://github.com/alandotcom/wfgraph/pull/196) [`eac8377`](https://github.com/alandotcom/wfgraph/commit/eac8377bda8ba7001b697366521533ea99797c4e) Thanks [@alandotcom](https://github.com/alandotcom)! - Add a Slack action for replying to an existing message thread.

- [#157](https://github.com/alandotcom/wfgraph/pull/157) [`dea6043`](https://github.com/alandotcom/wfgraph/commit/dea6043a2455cda99058ac23d6e4421751c1e606) Thanks [@alandotcom](https://github.com/alandotcom)! - Let a Resend connection be granted full access, which is what Resend requires to read templates. The client metadata document now registers both of Resend's scopes rather than `emails:send` alone. The registered set is the ceiling on what an operator may grant, so registering one scope was what grayed out "Full access" on Resend's consent page; registering both makes the page's own Permission chooser live. The authorization names no scope, which asks for the whole registered set and leaves the choice where it is made.

  An `IntegrationOAuth` adapter can report `grantedAccessLabel` on its token set: how much access the provider granted, in the provider's own words, read off the token response rather than assumed from the request. Both `exchange` and `refresh` return it, so a provider that narrows a grant is recorded rather than left claiming the old access. The connection dialog shows it read-only beside the account, and offers Reconnect on a working connection, which is the only thing that can change a grant.

### Patch Changes

- [#157](https://github.com/alandotcom/wfgraph/pull/157) [`dea6043`](https://github.com/alandotcom/wfgraph/commit/dea6043a2455cda99058ac23d6e4421751c1e606) Thanks [@alandotcom](https://github.com/alandotcom)! - Keep OAuth-provided credentials read-only while allowing other connection settings to be edited and tested with the saved OAuth grant, including Resend grants limited to email sending. A connection test now learns which credentials an OAuth grant issued, through a second `IntegrationTestContext` argument on the integration `test` function. The editor reports a credential field as configured from what the server actually stored, so a disconnected connection shows an empty field rather than a filled one, and it keeps offering the OAuth flow so a disconnect stays reversible. `slack({ oauthClient })` reads a pair that is blank on both sides as manual-only, which lets a host pass its environment straight through.

- [#195](https://github.com/alandotcom/wfgraph/pull/195) [`a4ea00d`](https://github.com/alandotcom/wfgraph/commit/a4ea00dc09c27261e3c9db321fc4efc7fb3548fa) Thanks [@alandotcom](https://github.com/alandotcom)! - Bump es-toolkit to 1.52 and import it by subpath. The published option types now declare `| undefined` on their optional properties, which matters to an adopter compiling with `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`: a maybe-undefined value can now be passed straight into an optional field instead of being filtered out first.

- [#181](https://github.com/alandotcom/wfgraph/pull/181) [`cbd75a8`](https://github.com/alandotcom/wfgraph/commit/cbd75a8e57b27d242ffededcd1d866d92fa377f1) Thanks [@alandotcom](https://github.com/alandotcom)! - Fail a Resend send whose Tags or Template Variables box does not parse, rather than
  sending the email without them. Tags are an output other nodes reference by key, so a
  dropped box left every downstream `tags.order_id` reading nothing while the run reported
  success. The three content modes now name the field a builder still has to fill in as the
  form labels it: "Content Mode is HTML, so HTML Body must be filled in."

Document forward-compatible action evolution in `docs/integrations.md`.

  outside the workflow, and hold a Group to lookups on that answer. `defineAction`
  and an integration's action literal both take the field, it defaults to `false`,
  and it reaches the browser on the extension catalog. The seven writes the
  built-in plugins ship now declare it, so grouping a Send Email or a Delete User
  is refused rather than accepted against the Group contract.

  Fix two Group defects on the canvas. Deleting a frame with the Delete key left
  its interior edges and any collapsed inlet edge in the graph naming steps that
  were gone, which the next save refused. An edge running from one frame's exit
  into another frame's entry painted on the two members instead of the two frames,
  so auto-layout read the frames as unconnected.

  Cut some of the canvas render cost. A graph whose nodes were left out of the
  order React Flow wants paid a re-sort and an allocation on every render, drag
  frames included, and grouping a second selection, ungrouping one of two frames,
  and pasting a frame each left it that way; all three now keep the order. The
  painted edges also come back as the array they went in as for a graph with no
  frame, though one holding a frame still rebuilds them per node change.

  Resend, Slack, Twilio), the `acuity` export and its `integrationUi` entry are gone, and the
  `@fountain-bio/acuity` dependency is dropped. A host importing `acuity` by name must delete
  that import; a host passing `builtInIntegrations` needs no change. Stored `acuity`
  connections and any workflow node on an `acuity/*` action no longer resolve to a registered
  integration.

  offering to let someone add one, and declares `engines.node` at the Node 24 floor the repo
  already builds against, so an install on an older runtime warns instead of failing later.

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- First published release. `@wfgraph/core` carries the run engine, the authoring
  vocabulary and `createWfGraphApp`; `@wfgraph/client` carries the editor bundle a
  host hands it; `@wfgraph/plugins` carries the six built-in integrations.
